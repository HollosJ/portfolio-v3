    Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm James, a front-end developer based in the North-West of
    England. I love the art of crafting exceptional web experiences using the
    latest technologies.

  <p>
    ðŸ’ª With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy exploring
    different technologies and tools like PHP, Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, and
    WordPress. By leveraging these technologies, I can create dynamic and
    visually stunning websites.
